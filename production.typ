The production of squeezed states of light essentially requires the generation of a mixing of a particular mode of the field with its conjugate mode. This ican not be achieved by transformations offered by linear optical devices (mirror, beam splitter, phase shifter). Th only way to achieve this is through the use of nonlinear optical devices.

In general, what we desire is a canonical Bogoliubov transformation of the form:
$
hat(b) = mu hat(a) + nu hat(a)^dagger
$

With the constraint that $|mu|^2 - |nu|^2 = 1$.
This transformation is a linear transformation of the creation and annihilation operators of the mode $hat(a)$, which is the mode we are interested in. The $hat(b)$ operator is the new mode that we are creating through this transformation. The $mu$ and $nu$ terms are complex numbers that determine the extent of mixing between the two modes. The constraint ensures that the transformation preserves the bosonic commutation relations - which means that $hat(b)$ and $hat(b)^dagger$ still satisfy the commutation relations that the original operators $hat(a)$ and $hat(a)^dagger$ satisfied. This is important because it ensures that the new mode $hat(b)$ behaves like a bosonic mode, just like the original mode $hat(a)$.

Where controlling $mu$ and $nu$ allows us to control the extent of squeezing.

Phrased in other terms, what we require is a Hamiltonian that contains quadratic terms in the creation and annihilation operators of that mode. This is given in the general form:

$
H = i h/(2 pi) kappa ((hat(a)^(dagger))^2 - hat(a)^2)
$

This can be achieved through two main methods:

1. Degenerate Parametric Down-Conversion ($Chi^((2))$): Here, a strong classical photon pump is used to drive a $Chi^((2))$ crystal at ssome frequency $2 omega$. this results in the creation of two photons of almost perfectly correlated phases of $omega$, and the process gives us an interaction Hamiltonian of the form mentioned above. The extent of squeezing is controlled by the non-linear susceptibility of the crystal used.
2. Degenerate 4-wave mixing ($Chi^((3))$): Same as the previous method, but in this case we use two photon pumps to drive the crystal with two photons of some frequency $omega$. This generates two photons that are again nearly perfectly correlated in phase. This gives us a nearly identical interaction Hamiltonian and the same Bogoliubov transformation as before.
