== Quantum-Noiseâ€“Limited Interferometry

High-precision interferometric measurements (e.g. gravitational-wave detectors, cavity-length stabilization) are fundamentally limited by quantum shot noise and radiation-pressure back-action.  Injecting squeezed vacuum into the interferometer's unused port reduces fluctuations in the pertinent quadrature, thereby lowering the noise floor. 

== Phase-Sensitive Amplification

Conventional, phase-insensitive amplifiers must add at least half a quantum of noise per quadrature.  In contrast, a *phase-sensitive parametric amplifier* based on a $chi^((2))$ or $chi^((3))$ nonlinearity can amplify one quadrature without excess added noise by locking to the squeezed quadrature. 

== Optical Communication Channels

Yuen and Shapiro @Yuen1978 first proposed encoding information in a squeezed-quadrature field to surpass the classical Shannon limit imposed by coherent-state (shot-noise) channels.  By modulating the squeezed quadrature and homodyning at the receiver, one can achieve a signal-to-noise ratio increased by a factor $e^(2r)$ over a coherent-state channel for the same mean photon number . Thus we can lock onto the squeezed quadrature to achieve a higher signal to noise ratio, and the noise can be put into the other quadrature.


== Optical Waveguide Taps and Quantum-Limited Routing

Shapiro @Shapiro1980 showed that tapping an optical waveguide with a squeezed-state probe can extract a portion of the signal with arbitrarily low back-action when the probe is squeezed in the appropriate quadrature.  This *optical waveguide tap* enables non-invasive monitoring of guided signals over multikilometer networks without intermediate optical amplifiers, offering a route to quantum-enhanced data buses and sensing arrays .
