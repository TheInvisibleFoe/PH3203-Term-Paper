To check for squeezed states we are interested in the second order correlation function. 
The second order correlation function, with parameters $x_1,x_2$ is given by
$ g^(2)(x_1,x_2) &= (G^((2))(x_1,x_2,x_1,x_2))/ (G^((1))(x_1,x_1) G^((1))(x_2,x_2)) \
            & = expval(bold(E)^-(x_1) bold(E)^-(x_2) bold(E)^+(x_1) bold(E)^+(x_2)) / (G^((1))(x_1,x_1) G^((1))(x_2,x_2)) \
$

We note that $bold(E)^+$ is an anhilation operator which reduces photon number and 
$bold(E)^-$ is a creation operator which increases photon number. So we
can write $N_E = bold(E)^-bold(E)^+$ is a number operator which counts the number of photons.
If the electric fields are classical , the number $N_E$ is a representation of the intensity 
of the light. So we can write the second order correlation function as
$ g^(2)(x_1,x_2) = expval(:N_E(x_1) N_E(x_2):) / (expval(N_(E(x_1))) expval(N_(E(x_2)))) $
where, $:X:$ represents the normal ordering of the operator $X$. The normal 
ordering of an operator is defined as the ordering of the operators such that all the
creation operators are to the left of the annihilation operators.

For example, for an operator $M = a^dagger a b^dagger b$, the normally ordered operator is
$ :M: = a^dagger b^dagger a b $.

Here, we consider time $t_1 = t$ and $ t_2 = t + tau$, and consider that we have
stationary fields. So we can write the second order correlation function  for 
$t_1 = 0, t_2 = tau$ as
$ g^(2)(tau) = g^(2)(0,tau) = expval(:N_E(0) N_E(tau):) / (expval(N_(E(0))) expval(N_(E(tau)))) $

#claim("Correlation function for coherent states")[

  For coherent states of the electric field, which are the eigenstates of the 
  $hat(a) = bold(E)^+$ operator.
  $ g^((2))(0) = 1 $
]

*Proof*: We see that the coherent states are defined as the eigenstates of the annihilation operator $a = E^+$, where fix the electric field in some polarization direction. So we can write
$ a ket(alpha) = alpha ket(alpha) $ where $alpha$ is a complex number. 
We can now calculate 
$ g^((2))(0)& =  expval(:N_E(x,0):)/expval(N_E(x,0))^2  
        quad =  expval(:a^dagger a a^dagger a:)/expval(a^dagger a)^2 \
        & =  expval(a^dagger a^dagger a a)/expval(a^dagger a)^2 
        quad  =  (bra(alpha) a^dagger a^dagger a a ket(alpha))/(|alpha|^2) 
         =  (|alpha|^2) /(|alpha|^2) = 1\
        $

For short counting times, the time delay in the second order correlation function is 
$tau = 0$.
#claim("Variance")[

  For sufficiently short counting times, the variance of the photon number distribution $V(n)$ is related to $g^((2))(0)$ by the relation
  $ (V(n) - expval(n))/expval(n)^2  = g^((2))(0)-1 $
]
*Proof*: Note that $N_E(x,0) = n$, which the photon number operator. Then the variance 
is given by 
$V(n) = expval(n^2) - expval(n)^2$
The second order correlation function is given by $ g^((2))(0) = (expval(:n^2:))/(expval(n)^2) $ Let us focus on the numerator, $expval(:n^2:) = expval(a^dagger a^dagger a a) = expval(a^dagger n a)$. We use the commutator relation $[n,a] = -a$ to get 
$ expval(:n^2:) = expval(a^dagger n a) = expval(a^dagger a^dagger a a) - expval(a^dagger a) = expval(n^2) - expval(n)$
Thus we get, from the definition of variance and the second order correlation function,
$ & g^((2))(0) = (expval(n^2) - expval(n))/(expval(n)^2) = (V(n) + expval(n)^2 - expval(n))/expval(n)^2 \
=> & g^((2))(0) - 1 = (V(n) - expval(n))/expval(n)^2 \
$

We know that photon statistics in the coherent state is poissonian. For poissonian
statistics, the variance is given by $V(n) = expval(n)$. So for poissonian statistics,
we have $g^((2))(0) = 1$. When $g^((0))<1$, we have sub-poissonian statistics and when $g^((2))(0)>1$, we have super-poissonian statistics. Sub-poissonian statistics exhibit an phenomenon called photon antibunching. *Write more about photon antibunching.*
