Light is fundamentally a quantum field comprising an ensemble of quantized harmonic oscillators, each characterized by two non‑commuting quadrature amplitudes whose uncertainties satisfy the Heisenberg bound. In 1983, Walls demonstrated that one may redistribute these fluctuations so as to suppress noise in a chosen quadrature below the coherent‑state (standard quantum) limit—a phenomenon now known as “quadrature squeezing.” Such squeezed states constitute a nonclassical resource capable of surpassing conventional quantum‑noise constraints.
