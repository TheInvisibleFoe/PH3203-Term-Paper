Some important literature in this field of study is:

- Review Article: 'Nonclassical' states in quantum optics: a 'squeezed' review of the first 75 years (V. Dodonov, 2002. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1088/1464-4266/4/1/201) - This paper provides a historical review of the development of "nonclassical states" in quantum optics over the past 75 years, tracing the origins of concepts like coherent and squeezed states to early work in the 1920s and covering the subsequent research in this area up to the 1990s.
- Generation of squeezed states of light (A. Lane, 1986) - The paper provides a review of the current status of squeezed state generation and an analysis of squeezing in nondegenerate four-wave mixing in two-level atoms, including a detailed examination of different pump configurations and the conditions for optimal squeezing.
- Coherent and Squeezed States: Introductory Review of Basic Notions, Properties, and Generalizations (O. Rosas-Ortiz, 2018. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-20087-9_7) - The paper provides a comprehensive review of the basic properties and generalizations of coherent and squeezed states, including their historical development, mathematical formulations, and connections to classical electromagnetic theory.
- 30 years of squeezed light generation (U. Andersen, et. al. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1088/0031-8949/91/5/053001) - The paper provides a comprehensive review of the history and development of squeezed light generation over the past 30 years.
- Squeezed Light (A. Lvovsky, 2014. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1002/9783527695805.ch9) - The paper reviews the basic properties, preparation, detection, and applications of single- and dual-mode squeezed light states.
